This is my sofle zmk config.

To build and flash you need:
 - install [devenv](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/
)
 - `devenv shell` or `direnv allow` to enter the development shell
 - `zmk-init` to fetch zmk and deps
 - `zmk-build-left`/`zmk-build-right` to build firmware
 - `zmk-flash-left`/`zmk-flash-right` to flash firmware
